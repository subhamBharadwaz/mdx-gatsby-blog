## Learn, Grow and Earn

### Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Who said that? SURE you can die! **You want to die?!** _Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex._ Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

### Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Guess again. No, I'm Santa Claus!

1. I wish! It's a nickel.
2. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
3. You know, I was God once.

#### Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

Ummm…to eBay? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Why would a robot need to drink? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

- Oh God, what have I done?
- These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
- Shinier than yours, meatbag.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. No, I'm Santa Claus! Really?! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! But I've never been to the moon!

Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. We don't have a brig. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Hey, whatcha watching? I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Guess again. Noooooo!

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Bender, you risked your life to save me! Meh. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. And I'm his friend Jesus. I'll get my kit!

We don't have a brig. I just told you! You've killed me! Do a flip! Really?! I love you, buddy! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Bender?! You stole the atom.

I'll get my kit! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

What are their names? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Bite my shiny metal ass. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
