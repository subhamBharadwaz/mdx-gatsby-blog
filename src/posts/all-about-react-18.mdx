## All About React 18

### You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Pansy. Kif might! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? **Is the Space Pope reptilian!?** _In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!_ Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

#### No, just a regular mistake.

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

1. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.
2. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
3. Belligerent and numerous.

#### Bite my shiny metal ass.

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No, I'm Santa Claus! Hello Morbo, how's the family? I had more, but you go ahead.

- Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.
- I'm Santa Claus!
- Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I don't want to be rescued. Kids have names? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Do a flip! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?

We're also Santa Claus! Negative, bossy meat creature! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Your best is an idiot! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

We're rescuing ya. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Hey, whatcha watching? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. We're rescuing ya.

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I'm Santa Claus! Say it in Russian! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! You are the last hope of the universe.

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Shinier than yours, meatbag.

Ooh, name it after me! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Hey, whatcha watching?
